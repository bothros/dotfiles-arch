This contains dotfiles for my arch setup, using i3.

This repo contains stuff I want on a personal machine I'm setting up myself, using arch.

The regular dotfiles repo contains stuff I want on pretty much any system, namely my vimrc.

A list of some specific packages I've needed to install is in the file 'packages', as a reminder to myself when I try this on another machine.

These dotfiles will start up X on tty 1, whenever you log in, so you may need to log into another TTY in case of video card problems.
